	<h2 id="intro">1. 概述</h2>
	<p>W3C将在扩展开放Web平台的同时，继续增强其安全性以及对Web用户隐私的保护。当谈及安全的问题是，每一个人都很关心。我们将把Web安全提到前所未有的高度，确保关于Web安全具体的需求被满足，并且与工业界、学术界、广大公众以及其他标准化组织一起。</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>"When strong authentication is easy to deploy, we make the Web safer for daily use, personal and commercial. With the scope and frequency of attacks increasing, it is imperative for W3C to develop new standards and best practices for increased security on the Web."</p>
	  <address class="QuotAttr">Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Web Inventor and W3C Director.</address>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Strengthening and securing the core is a requirement. Another is to be on the lookout for emerging areas, exploring what new application areas in general might mean for the underlying Open Web Platform, looking at where the Web is going to be able to identify where interoperability is needed in the new Web. W3C continues to think about the future of the Web. See below a few candidates which bear the potential of growing the capability of the core Open Web Platform.</p>
	<p>In parallel, we have broadened our focus on vertical industries. Application Foundations of the Open Web Platform are fluid in nature given their multiple interconnections —such as Security implications of device interactions, or Accessibility considerations of streaming media— but the future of the Web is informed by the future of Industry. Most are building their business on the Web and participate in our work to address Web-specific requirements they have. Those requirements fit into more than one Vertical aspect and accross several of our key horizontal activities. Our Industry Vertical Champion Program shapes the future of the Web in the Industry.</p>
	<p>The Web is a set of technologies for developing distributed applications with the greatest interoperability in history. According to a <a href="http://www.visionmobile.com/product/developer-economics-state-of-the-developer-nation-q3-2015/">survey last July</a>, 47% of developers are using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript when building applications —up 5% in a year. The promise of the Open Web Platform is to lower the cost of developing powerful applications to reach the most people, on any device. We continue to attempt to capture this focus on developers through our <a href="/appfoundations/">Application Foundations</a> framework.</p>
	
	<h2 id="security">2. 安全</h2>
	<p>Web安全持续成为Web平台和W3C关心的首要问题。Web是一个被广泛使用且具有多样性的平台，新的功能不断被添加进来——社交网络、视频、移动等，所有这些Web平台的新生事物都不断增强平台的影响力，并持续满足相关产业界的需求。W3C 也按照 Web用户安全、Web应用安全、Web平台安全的优先级顺序，不断致力于解决 Web平台的安全问题。</p>
	<p>We have taken a number of steps since TPAC 2015 to improve the security and privacy of the Web Platform and two upcoming Web security milestones are WebCrypto &amp; Killing Passwords.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Progress in Web Application Security enable Web Application developers to secure their apps, cooperate with the browser environment on enforcement of security policies, and make it easier for large deployed sites to upgrade their security to HTTPS.
	  </li>
	  <li>Killing Passwords: <a href="/2016/02/securewebauthwg.html.en">Launched</a> in February, the <a href="/Webauthn/">Web Authentication Working group</a> will specify a Web API for strong authentication on the Web; a real opportunity to move beyond passwords to a more usable and more secure authentication experience on the Web.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="crypto-authn">2.1 Web加密与认证</h3>
	<p>The <a href="/TR/WebCryptoAPI/">Web Cryptography API</a>, anticipated to progress to Proposed Recommendatio, is about performing basic cryptographic operations in web applications. These are core components for libraries to build upon, avoiding the need for developers to "roll their own" solutions.</p>
	<p>The <a href="/2015/12/web-authentication-charter.html">Web Authentication Working Group charter</a> illustrates another field where the standardization pushed by W3C serves the telecommunications industry: the adoption of the FIDO-based authentication methods in browsers promises to simplify identity management, an important need that operators can both help fulfill and benefit from. Chartered to specify a Web API for strong authentication on the Web, this work gives us the real opportunity to move beyond passwords, to a more usable and more secure authentication experience on the Web.</p>
	
	<h3 id="hasec">2.2 硬件安全（Hardware-Based Security）</h3>
	<p>With the prospects of bringing the high security ensured by hardware-tokens to the Web platform, we are continuing development of a Hardware Security Working Group draft charter.</p>
	
	<p>There are a number of use cases that this standard will enable, including but not limited to the ability to manage credential information for hardware-based security modules, and the ability to access specific security sensitive services offered by hardware tokens such as Payments transaction authorization andd Identity verification. </p>
	
	<h3 id="webappsec">2.3 Web应用安全</h3>
	<p>Content Security Policy Level 2, Mixed Content, Subresource Integrity, and Upgrade Insecure Requests are all Candidate Recommendations. These specs enable Web Application developers to secure their apps, cooperate with the browser environment on enforcement of security policies, and make it easier for large deployed sites to upgrade their security to HTTPS. Another significant deliverable from WebAppSec is the advancement to <a href="/TR/2016/WD-CSP3-20160126/">FPWD of Content Security Policy Level 3</a> late January.</p>
	<p>Drawing upon these specifications, <a href="/blog/news/archives/5263">W3C upgraded its own website to HTTPS</a>, offering encrypted, integrity-protected access to W3C resources and Recommendations.</p>
	
	<h3>Security and Privacy Reviews</h3>
	<p>We are systematically asking for Security and Privacy Considerations in charters and specification development. The TAG published a draft <a href="/TR/2015/NOTE-security-privacy-questionnaire-20151210/">Security and Privacy Self-Review Questionnaire</a>, with input from the Privacy Interest Group (PING) and Web Application Security Working Group, to help editors in making those assessments.</p>
	<p>PING and Web Security Interest Group offer assistance with specification review, and the Director will look for Security and Privacy Considerations at specification transitions.</p>
	
	<h3 id="privacy">2.4 隐私保护</h3>
	<p>The Tracking Protection Working Group sent the <a href="/TR/2015/CR-tracking-dnt-20150820/">Tracking Preference Expression (TPE)</a> to Candidate Recommendation and the Compliance Specification is almost there. These specs give a mechanism for expressing tracking preferences, and by which sites can indicate their compliance with user requests.</p>
	<p>PING published a draft of <a href="/TR/fingerprinting-guidance/">Fingerprinting Guidance for Web Specification Authors</a>.</p>
	
	
	<h2 id="champions">3. 基于开放Web平台的产业领域</h2>
	<p>As the impact of the Open Web Platform has grown, several industries are building their business platforms on top of the Web and using Web technology.</p>
	<p>Last October <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/10/w3c-highlights/#verticals">we presented</a> why the Industry is important to the Web and vice-versa, and introduced the Industry Vertical Champion Program,</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>to understand at a deep level the Web technology needs of the industry,</li>
	  <li>to understand what is important today and what will be important in the future,</li>
	  <li>to map the industry needs into specific Web technology needs, and</li>
	  <li>to address real, near-term business problems within the context of the core values of the Web ...</li>
	  <li>... in a global and inclusive way.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3 id="automotive">3.1 汽车</h3>
	<p>Automotive's future is made of rich user experiences, greater security and smarter location-based services. Drivers and passengers demand the same rich user experiences in vehicles that they enjoy with all their mobile and other devices. HTML5 and the Open Web Platform offer the best roadmap for new services, increased security and interoperability.</p>
	<p>W3C has been working with GENIVI to enhance our work with the automotive industry to the level of having a strong shared vision and partnership. The GENIVI Alliance is a non-profit automotive industry alliance committed to driving the broad adoption of an In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) open-source development platform.</p>
	<p>The <a href="/2014/automotive/">Automotive Working Group</a> is <a href="/TR/#tr_Automotive">advancing on the Recommendation Track</a> the W3C Vehicle Information API, which aims to enable connectivity through in-vehicle infotainment systems and vehicle data access protocols and can be leveraged by web applications running on mobile devices that access the data resources of a connected passenger vehicle. A companion, the Vehical Data API, defines a standard for Vehicle Data which might be available in a vehicle.</p>
	<p>The group is now engaging with different stakeholders and consumer groups in addressing data rights, and has established a Privacy and Security Task Force for Automotive.</p>
	<p>The Automotive and Web Platform Business Group, formed back in 2013, is pursuing work on a Location-Based Services API, and has handed use cases for automotive Media Tuner needs to the TV Control API Community Group. A draft charter for a TV Control Working Group is in the work.
	</p>
<p>The Open Web Platform helps reduce costs and complexity by replacing multiple proprietary approaches with a simplified global solution. Web applications built for vehicles using smartphones or embedded solutions are delivered as products or services. Areas where the Web can help auto:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Reducing driver distraction and improving safety</li>
	  <li>Location-based services, shopping, and customer engagement</li>
	  <li>Enhanced driving experiences and situational awareness</li>
	  <li>Integrating home, work, and travel</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="digital-marketing">3.2 数字营销（Digital Marketing）</h3>
	<p>W3C continues to explore this emerging industry vertical. The September 2015 <a href="/2015/digital-marketing-workshop/index.html">Digital Marketing workshop</a> identified three streams of work:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Security, reflected in the RequestVisibility API work underway in the Web Application Security Working Group</li>
	  <li>Advertising</li>
	  <li>Incentives</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A draft Digital Advertising Interest Group seeks to provide a forum for technical discussions to identify Advertising use cases and requirements to achieve a simpler, more direct, dependable, and reliable model to deliver and measure ads on the web. An Incentives Interest Group would address web-based customer relations, improving the ability to customize loyalty programs and offers, responsive to users' privacy and purchasing interests.</p>
	<p>W3C is considering an e-Commerce W3C Workshop later in 2016. Consumer purchasing behaviour is shifting to mobile and the revenue generated by advertising or functionality or entertainment in exchange for a purchase price, is dwarfed by the quantity of e-Commerce transactions being conducted through mobile applications.</p>
	
	<h3 id="digital-publishing">3.3 数字出版（Digital Publishing）</h3>
	<p>To change the way books, magazines and journals are created and published, the <a href="/2015/09/digpubig">Digital Publishing Interest Group</a> is continuing work on Portable Web Publications, having issued several drafts of <a href="/TR/pwp/">Portable Web Publications for the Open Web Platform</a> —a vision for the future of digital publishing that achieves full convergence between online and offline documents— and has set up task forces on archiving and locators. The group collaborates with the ARIA Working Group for accessibility concerns, and the CSS Working Group on various issues related to the needs of the Digital Publishing Community.</p>
	<p>Additional Public Working Drafts published recently include <a href="/TR/2014/WD-dpub-latinreq-20140930/">Requirements for Latin Text Layout and Pagination</a> and <a href="/TR/2015/WD-dpub-aria-1.0-20151119/">Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0</a>.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="entertainment">3.4 娱乐（Entertainment）</h3>
	<h4 id="html-media">HTML媒体</h4>
	<p>The industry and the Consortium choice is to enhance HTML to be capable of playing video content without the help of plug-in video players, streaming technologies over HTTP such as Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) has rapidly emerged in the industry. W3C took to develop two HTML5 extensions to enable <abbr title="User Agent">UA</abbr>s to play such streams. 
	</p>
<p>These extensions are essential to meet the industry requirements for video content delivery on the Web, by providing Web apps with more flexible control over video content, which enable advanced services such as dynamic ad-insertion.
	</p>
<p>HTML Media, core media features of Web platform, is developed in HTML (Media Extensions) Working Group, previously called the HTML Working Group, while new features of core Web standards are crafted in Web Platform Working Group.
	</p>
	<p>Ongoing work:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> The HTML (Media Extensions) WG is currently working on two extensions: Media Source Extensions (MSE) and Encrypted Media Extensions (EME).</li>
	  <li> MSE is a candidate recommendation that allows JavaScript to send byte streams to media codecs within Web browsers that support HTML5 video. (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/media-source">MSE on Github</a>)</li>
	  <li> EME is a working draft for providing a communication channel between Web browsers and digital rights management (DRM) agent software. This allows the use of HTML5 video to play back DRM-wrapped content such as streaming video services without the need for third-party media plugins like Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight. (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/encrypted-media/">EME on Github</a>)</li>
	  <li> version 1.0 of the two extensions are planned to become W3C Recommendations sometime by the end of this year. </li>
	  <li> There are some industry requests to include additional features such as continuous key rotation to meet original requirements of extensions. The group is in the process of deciding which feature should go to version 1.0. TPAC 2016 will be an important milestone for this work.</li>
	  <li> To make them RECs in time, the group is putting more efforts on improving testing.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="second-screen">第二屏工作组（Second Screen Working Group）</h4>
	<p>Web content is available on an ever expanding array of devices including eBook readers, phones, tablets, laptops, auto displays, and electronic billboards, and there are a variety of mechanisms that allow these devices to use secondary display screens available in the local environment, attached by wired connections or remotely with wireless, peer-to-peer media. However, in most cases, lower layers such as OS provide those connection mechanisms, which Web apps, consequently, have no access and control over. Web apps should be capable of implementing services which cover scenarios such as using a big screen device to watch a movie selected on and streamed from a smartphone are getting more common as <abbr title="Over-the-top content">OTT</abbr> services like Netflix emerge.
	</p>
<p>The <a href="/2014/secondscreen/">Second Screen Working Group</a> aims at defining simple APIs that allow web applications to show and control web content on one or more secondary displays. Some of the group's work is incubated in the <a href="/community/webscreens/">Second Screen Community Group</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Ongoing work:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> Focus in 2015 was on the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/">Presentation API</a>. The interfaces defined in this specification have stabilized and the specification should move forward to Candidate Recommendation by mid-2016.</li>
	  <li> In parallel to the Presentation API, the group is now also developing the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/remote-playback/">Remote Playback API</a> that allows controlling remote playback of media from a web page.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="cloud-browser">云浏览器任务组（Cloud Browser Task Force）</h4>
	<p>The <a href="/2011/webtv/wiki/Main_Page/Cloud_Browser_TF">Cloud Browser Task Force</a>, a subset of the <a href="/2011/webtv/">Web and TV Interest Group</a>, discusses support for web browser technology within devices such as HDMI dongles and lightweight <abbr title="set-top box">STB</abbr>s.<br>
	  New cloud browser Runtime Environments (RTEs) require the definition of APIs that would enable communication between the cloud browser and the client. The Task Force will look into use cases, requirements and gaps in cloud UI architectures. 
	</p>
	<p>Ongoing work:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> To enable arbitrary Web apps to run on cloud browser RTEs, we need to modify some existing W3C APIs such as MSE and EME for video delivery services. This Task Force will figure out such gaps between cloud browser RTEs and existing Web standards.</li>
	  <li> The Task Force deals with not only TV-like-service-centric use cases but also use cases from other industries such as gaming, signage, etc, if the TF gets interest or contribution from the stakeholders.</li>
	  <li> This technology can achieve architectural flexibility about User Agents or Web browsers, which can provide users with better privacy and security; and cloud service providers with a different level of control over Web browsing features.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="ggie">屏幕到屏幕互联网生态系统（GGIE ，Glass-to-Glass Internet Ecosystem）任务组</h4>
	<p>Thanks to the international and interdependent standards developed by global organizations including W3C, IETF, IEEE, CEA, SMPTE, MPEG, etc. the Internet-based or Web-based video content delivery services are expanding in the entertainment content market. Because of the distributed and sometime ad-hoc nature of the efforts, there is a need to go back to use cases: capture existing use cases, analyze them, and enhance them to further develop new standards for better services.</p>
	<p>The <a href="/2011/webtv/wiki/GGIE_TF">GGIF Task Force</a>, a subset of the Web and TV Interest Group, discusses the end to end Internet digital video ecosystem, focusing on all phases of the video life cycle: Capture-Edit-Package-Distribute-Find-Watch for both professional and non-professional digital video, and will identify recommended standards and features that could be developed.</p>
	<p> Ongoing work:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> The TF finished its first round at TPAC 2015 in Sapporo, with a report in which it emphasized that flexible content identification more than traditional in- and out-band content-id and metadata would be the key component for GGIE. It would use ID-less content identification such as fingerprint and watermark technologies in addition to conventional content-id systems.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="tvcontrol-api">电视控制 API 社区组</h4>
	<p>In 2014, The Web and TV IG launched the <a href="/community/tvapi/">TV Control API Community Group</a> to create a draft specification about APIs that make Web apps capable of accessing TV tuners and other broadcasting resources. TV sets are another major type of devices which use HTML5 as its run-time engine. Some regional SDOs have created HTML5-based run-time engines for their TV specs by expanding HTML5 in their space. This caused a fragmentation of Web apps on TV. TV-like user interfaces are still common on big screen devices, thus it is useful to provide generic APIs to easily create such UIs in an underlying-layer-agnostic way.
	</p>
	<p>Ongoing work:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> The <a href="http://w3c.github.io/tvapi/spec/">TV Control API Specification</a>, developed as a way to address this fragmentation issue, was published as final Community Group report in November 2015. </li>
	  <li> The Auto BG is providing the TV Control API CG use cases for automotive Media Tuner needs.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="multi-device-timing">多设备计时社区组（Multi-device Timing Community Group）</h4>
	<p>In 2015, The Web and TV IG launched the <a href="/community/webtiming/">Multi-device Timing Community Group</a> to a create draft specification that defines a common, multi-device, timing mechanism and a practical programming model e.g. to allow Web apps to synchronize the playback of multiple streams on multiple devices. Timing mechanisms allow operations to be executed at the correct time. The Web already has several mechanisms, some of which may be custom, and the Web lacks support for multi-device timing. More generally, multi-device timing has wide utility in communication, collaboration and multi-screen presentation.</p>
	<p>Multi-device timing is particularly important for the broadcasting industry, as it is the key enabler for web-based secondary device offerings. This mechanism would also improve accessibility of the Web media content. For example, third party can easily provide additional audio track, such as <a href="/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/#clean-audio">Clean Audio</a>.</p>
	<p>Ongoing work:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> The Multi-device Timing CG has developed an initial draft of the <a href="https://webtiming.github.io/timingobject/">Timing Object</a> specification, along with a reference polyfill implementation in JavaScript.</li>
	  <li> Since TPAC 2015, the group has reached out to various members to gather feedback on the topic in general and on the proposed approach in particular, with a view to assessing practical next steps from a standardization perspective. Contributions to the discussions would be particularly welcome!</li>

	<h3 id="telecommunications">3.5 电信</h3>
	<p>Telecommunication remains the largest vertical represented in W3C Membership; the recent addition of Japan-based Softbank (which also owns Sprint in the US) strengthens further this representation. The W3C agenda continues to support important challenges and opportunities that emerge from the telco industry.</p>
	
	<h4>Upcoming work:</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li> The WebRTC work continues apace, with Candidate Recommendation planned for the two main APIs behind the technology (getUserMedia &amp; WebRTC) in the upcoming few weeks, following successful F2F meetings during the fall.</li>
	  <li> Once WebRTC 1.0 reaches Candidate Recommendation, work will start in earnest on the next version of WebRTC, which aims at converging with the work started in the ORTC Community Group. </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Security tie-in:</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li> The charter of the <a href="/webauthn">Web Authentication Working Group</a> illustrates another field where the telecommunications industry is bound to benefit from the standardization pushed by W3C: the adoption of the FIDO-based authentication methods in browsers promises to simplify identity management, an important need that operators can both help fulfill and benefit from.</li>
	  <li>A <a href="/2015/hasec/2015-hasec-charter.html">Hardware Security Working Group draft charter</a> (currently under Advisory Committee review) entertains the prospect of bringing the high security ensured by hardware-tokens (such as SIM cards) to the Web platform.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Device perspective:</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li> The work on generic Sensor API pushed by the Device APIs Working Group (soon to be renamed Device &amp; Sensors Working Group) promises to make the Web a more malleable platform when it comes to interaction with physical sensors. </li>
	  <li> Discussions on bringing the work of the Web Bluetooth Community Group and the Web NFC Community Group to standardization have also started, after their successful meetings at TPAC 2015.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Overlapping work:</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li> See the <a href="#entertainment">Entertainment section</a>. Many operators also provide media services to their customers; the activity in the Web and TV interest group continues to provide new capabilities for Web-based services in this area, as illustrated by the ongoing work on the TV Control API, Web-based synchronization. Following their F2F meeting at TPAC, the Interest Group created a new task force to work on cloud-rendering, facilitating the deployment of Web-based media services in thin-clients (e.g. set top boxes).</li>
	  <li> See the <a href="#webpayments">Web Payments section</a>. W3C work on Payments and Internet of Things completes the picture of the many places where the telecommunication industry can bring its expertise and its requirements to the future of the Web.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="wot">3.6 物联万维网（Web of Things）</h3>
	<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) could be the next driver on the Internet, provided we have a model which makes broad sharing available for it. IoT refers to services for connected sensors and actuators. <a href="http://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/iot-connected-devices-to-triple-to-38-bn-by-2020">Juniper Research expects</a> the number of IoT connected devices to rise to 38.5 billion in 2020 (from 13.4 billion in 2015). Gartner expects a huge business potential and predicts the aggregate benefits forecast to be $1.9 trillion across sectors in 2020.</p>
	<p>Today’s architectures and initial implementations tend to be silo-ed. There are standards at the physical layer but insufficient interoperability at the higher layers. The Web of Things (WoT) defines a Web-based interoperability layer on top of existing IoT platforms, using a uniform approach to semantics and metadata, thus countering fragmentation and fostering the business potential currently held back due to incompatible platforms and a bewildering range of protocols.</p>
	<p>For example, a person’s watch (as an IoT device) will want to participate in IoT wearable applications (since it is worn), IoT medical applications (as it takes one’s pulse and links into personal medical information), IoT Smart Homes (used to control the home), IoT Smart Cities (as the municipal infrastructure relies on data about weather and traffic), and IoT Smart Factories (to track its usage and condition). But to participate across all silos, and for applications to be built which leverage all silos requires common data models, metadata, and an interoperable layered model.</p>
	<p>The Web of Thing model complements IoT by providing a higher level interoperability layer above IoT. W3C is unique in tackling the Internet of Things from the perspective of application developers, with an approach that frees you from the complexities of the protocols and communication patterns — these can be chosen to match the specific needs for each context.</p>

	<h4>Ongoing work:</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>The <a href="/WoT/IG/">Web of Things Interest Group</a> is defining standard vocabularies, APIs and protocol bindings, security, privacy and resilience, along with enablers for dynamic open markets of services including discovery, automated negotiation of prices, terms and conditions, provisioning, payments and support throughout the product lifecycle from design to obsolescence.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="webpayments">3.7 Web支付</h3>
	<p>E-commerce is growing as a proportion of all commerce. According to Forrester, the web in 2018 will account for 11% of total retail sales, up from 8% in 2013. However, a number of challenges are limiting the potential of E-commerce, such as fraud losses, user expectations in particular with mobile device usage, technology (Biometrics, Web of Things, Automotive advances, and NFC adoption), regulation.</p>
	<p>The historic dichotomy between the design point of the Web and how it is used by merchants is striking. The Web is user-centric. It is designed to connect humanity to information. e-Commerce has historically been merchant-centric. A merchant makes their product available on their site for a customer to come in and buy.</p>
	<p>But e-Commerce has changed. In today’s omni-channel model, the customer is in charge. They receive information from social media and recommendation websites. They combine in-store with on-line; and expect service from laptop and mobile. There are enormous changes and more flexibility in payment methods. Users are looking and finding the best deal and most importantly the best overall experience.</p>
	<p>The underlying payment and e-commerce infrastructure will be “web-like”. In addition to connecting humanity to information, we will better connect humanity with their economic potential.</p>
	<h4>Ongoing work:</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>The <a href="/Payments/WG/">Web Payments Working Group</a> is looking at how to improve the e-Commerce user experience by streamlining the checkout process and improving security. Ian Jacobs has written a <a href="/blog/wpwg/2016/03/04/fpwd/">summary</a> of the Working Group’s recent discussion and plan to publish a First Public Working Draft in early April of what we believe will be transformative new Web technology.</li>
	  <li>Ultimately, we will need a broad set of offerings. The <a href="/Payments/IG/">Web Payments Interest Group</a>, where 120 people now participate, discussed a number of topics as fodder for new standardization efforts. These included the impact of regulatory changes such as the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) in Europe, as well as faster-payments initiatives such as those of the US Federal Reserve. The group also discussed use cases for “verifiable claims” on the Web, opened a discussion on blockchain and the Web, and discussed interoperability with the broader financial services ecosystem (e.g., through alignment with ISO20022).</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="application-development">4. 应用开发</h2>
	<h3 id="html">4.1 HTML</h3>
	<p>Progress are being made to ensuring that HTML is truly part of the extensible Web, to enable feature development and iteration through the use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
	<h4>Extensible Web &amp; (real) Web Applications</h4>
	<p>The work on Web components (Custom Elements, Shadom DOM, HTML imports) is closer to completion and getting broader consensus around some of the Core issues. This brings us closer to a realilty when developers will be able to provide their own custom HTML elements, as components.</p>
	<p>We are also ensuring that Web applications are able to be behave like real applications. The Core of this work happens around the Service Workers effort, to enable offline support, application lifecycles (such as install, update), and background tasks (offline notification). This allows the application to install properly and ensure from the start that the needed resources are available offline.</p>
	<h4>HTML specs on Github</h4>
	<p>The Web Platform Working Group also announced a <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2016Jan/0008.html">new plan</a> in order to maintain the HTML specification. The specification was moved to GitHub and transformed to facilitate its edition, in order to promote the widest participation possible.</p>
	<p>We encourage the community at large to contribute and help the maintenance of the specification. The focus is on making changes to promote interoperability to produce a new Recommendation. New features are encouraged to go through an incubation phase before being brought to the Working Group, in order to demonstrate buy-in from a sizeable community.</p>
	<h4>Track for HTML 5.1 REC</h4>
	<p>The group is on track to deliver a Recommendation for HTML 5.1 this year, with a working approach that will make it possible to deliver a further improved HTML Recommendation in another year or two. Read the Web Platform Working Group co-chairs's <a href="/blog/2016/03/html-whats-next/">invitation to get involved</a> and make sure the development of HTML continues to reflect the needs and goals of the broad community.</p>
	
	<h3 id="css">4.2 CSS</h3>
	<p>The CSS Working Group is continuing its refinement and progress of the CSS language. The definition for the current state of CSS was updateed with the publication of the <a href="/TR/CSS/">CSS Snapshot 2015</a> document. Its primary audience is CSS implementers, not CSS authors, as this definition includes modules by specification stability, not Web browser adoption rate.</p>
	
	<h3 id="timed-text">4.3 时序文本（Timed Text）</h3>
	<p>While continuing its work on the TTML Text and Image Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions, known as IMSC, the work of the Working Group received an <a href="/2016/01/emmyawardttml.html.en">Emmy ® Award for Standards Work on Accessible Video Captioning and Subtitles</a>. The award recognizes W3C’s Timed Text Markup Language (TTML) standard that helps ensure that the needs of people with disabilities, particularly people who are deaf or hard of hearing, are addressed. This work, begun in WAI, enables online captioning, which is critically important to ensure accessibility of TV and video on the web for people who are deaf and hard of hearing. In recent years with the convergence of traditional media and the Web, more video content from television is coming to the Web, and the Web is now running on televisions. TTML helps to bridge these worlds.	</p>
	
	<h2 id="web-for-all">5. 面向所有人的Web（Web for All）</h2>
	
	<h3 id="i18n">5.1 国际化（Internationalization，i18n）</h3>
	<p>Fewer than one third of current Web users speak English as their native language and that proportion will continue to decrease as the Web reaches more and more communities of limited English proficiency. If the Web is to live up to the "World Wide" portion of its name, it must support the needs of world-wide users at a basic level as they engage with content in the various languages. The W3C Internationalization activities pursue this goal in various ways, including coordination with other organizations, creation of educational materials, coordination on the work of other W3C groups, gathering user requirements, and technical work itself on various topics:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Reviews, discussion and advice for W3C specification developers:<br>
	Ongoing work for the i18n WG is review and comments related to specifications of a number of Working Groups. In particular, during this period, the i18n Working Group has been working with WGs such as WebVTT, CSV, and Web Annotation to explore best practices for handling bidi content in plain text environments.</li>
	<li>Testing:<br>
	Significant effort went into the creation of <a href="/International/tests/repo/results/encoding-dbl-byte">double-byte</a> and <a href="/International/tests/#encoding-spec">other tests</a> for the Encoding specification, which is currently in CR, with a full set of results for major browsers. This constitutes a significant step forward. Implementation of the spec is still ongoing.</li>
	<li>Publications:<br>
	The Working Group published further updates to the Working Draft of <a href="/TR/charmod-norm/">Character Model for the World Wide Web: String Matching and Searching</a>, previously called Character Model for the World Wide Web: Normalization.<br>
	Aimed at W3C specification developers, the new Working Draft removes much material that was outdated and extends the content into other areas where string matching considerations apply, beyond those of normalization.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Better OWP support for the world's languages</h4>
	<p>Work is moving forward slowly but steadily on specifying layout and typographic requirements (see <a href="/International/layout">Layout &amp; typography</a>). The major new initiative to standardize Mongolian variant forms in Unicode which is using Internationalization activity lists is now nearing completion. Many of the world's top Mongolian font experts are collaborating in this effort. Recommendations are being taken to the Unicode Technical Committee.</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="http://w3c.github.io/alreq/">Arabic Layout Requirements</a> work is progressing steaidly.</li>
	  <li>There is also significant new activity on <a href="http://w3c.github.io/elreq/">Ethiopic Layout Requirements</a>.</li> 
	  <li><a href="/TR/clreq/">Requirements for Chinese Text Layout</a>, has made some progress. The <a href="http://w3c.github.io/clreq/">github draft</a> now includes a Simplified Chinese translation, ie. showing 3 language versions of the page.</li>
	  <li>A draft of <a href="http://w3c.github.io/tlreq/">Tibetan Layout Requirements</a> has been prepared as a base for work to engage expert participation.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>We are also working with browser developers to facilitate the implement of isolation for the dir attribute, which will significantly improve support for bidirectional text on the Web (eg. for Arabic, Hebrew, Thaana, etc).</p>
	
	<h4>MultilingualWeb</h4>
	<p>We continued again in liaison with OASIS the work on have the <a href="/TR/its20/">Internationalization Tag Set (ITS) 2.0 specification</a> available natively in XLIFF. This work will be documented in XLIFF 2.1, so that XLIFF tools conformant to the related XLIFF 2.1 module will understand ITS natively. This work should be completed in Q1-Q2 2016 and help the adoption of Web technologies in the localization realm a lot.</p>
	<p>Work on linguistic linked data continues in various community groups. The BPMLOD CG published various <a href="/community/bpmlod/#group-reports">guidelines</a> for converting existing data into linguistic linked data resources. This conversion helps to foster cross-lingual access on the Web.</p>
	
	<h4>Outreach and education</h4>
	<p>The group continues to maintain and add to its collection of articles for content developers, helping them understand and work with internationalisation-related features of the Web. See the list of <a href="/International/techniques/authoring-html-dynamic">techniques index for authoring HTML and CSS content</a>, which points to resources on a task-by-task basis. </p>
	<p>Internationalization groups participants also deliver talks and seminars to raise awareness about Multilingual Web and encourage participation in the work at the W3C.  They spoke about their work at the Internationalization &amp; Unicode Conference in Santa Clara, last October. In February, they were part of a <a href="http://www.unicode-oman.org/">Unicode workshop in Oman</a>. It is expected that this will widen awareness of and support for work on typographic support in the Web Platform for non-Latin scripts.</p>
	<p>Support for internationalization content and the user forum was also provided for the HTML5 Mooc course run by the W3C.</p>

	<h3 id="accessibility">5.2 Web无障碍（Web accessibility）</h3>
	<h4>New accessibility guidance for authoring tools and user agents</h4>
	<p><a href="/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines</a> (UAAG) 2.0 is now a completed Working Group Note, and provides help for developers of browsers, browser extensions, mobile applications and eReaders interested in providing a more consistent level of support for the needs of people with disabilities and older users. <a href="/TR/2015/NOTE-UAAG20-Reference-20151215/">UAAG Reference: Explanations, Examples, and Resources</a> is an implementation guide for UAAG 2.0.</p>
	<p><a href="/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines</a> (ATAG) 2.0, which is a W3C Recommendation, helps authoring tool developers support more efficient production of accessible content and as well as interfaces that work better for web authors with disabilities and older users. Benefits which authoring tools that conform to ATAG 2.0 provide for developers of websites and web content are outlined in <a href="/WAI/intro/atag-glance">ATAG at a Glance</a>.</p>
	
	<h4> New work on web content accessibility underway</h4>
	<p>The flagship <a href="/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> (WCAG) 2.0 have been stable and widely used internationally since 2008. The WCAG Working Group is currently exploring several potential areas of new guidance, including in the areas of <a href="/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/">mobile accessibility</a>, <a href="/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/">cognitive and learning accessibility</a>, and <a href="/WAI/GL/low-vision-a11y-tf/">low vision accessibility</a>.</p>
	<p> Potential future work on combined guidelines across the areas of web content and applications, user agents, and authoring tools is also under exploration. </p>
	
	<h4>New work organization</h4>
	<p>Work on <a href="/TR/WAI-ARIA/">Accessibility Rich Internet Applications</a> (ARIA) has moved to a dedicated group (the <a href="/WAI/ARIA/">ARIA WG</a>) and is developing new features in <a href="/TR/wai-aria-1.1/">ARIA 1.0</a>. <a href="/WAI/ARIA/project">The ARIA Project Plan</a> shows progress on a full suite of ARIA documents, and Accessibility API Mapping (AAM) documents.</p>
	<p> Accessibility reviews of W3C specifications are proceeding in the <a href="/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures</a> (APA) Working Group. The splitting of the previous PFWG per Member reviews has not yet resulted in increased participation in this group, and new participants interested in reviewing accessibility support in W3C specifications are needed and welcome.</p>

	<p>W3C的工作重心向来都是其自始至终所坚守的—忠于尽展Web潜能这一宗旨—强化核心使命、探索与创新并最终扩展Web潜能。W3C着眼于新的应用领域、特性与服务，并密切关注可普遍用于其他应用的服务，“下一代”Web平台也将包含这些特性。</p>

	<p>当前，W3C致力于七项能够进一步促进核心开放Web平台潜在性能发展的领域。W3C计划将于2016年3月的春季顾问委员会会上与会员单位进行讨论。</p>

	<h3 id="nbt-html">8.1 Web的可扩展性与“真正的”Web应用</h3>
	<p>既然HTML5已经发布，下一阶段的工作重点之一就是真正可扩展的Web以及像真实应用程序一样运行的Web应用程序。Web可扩展性意味着精简应用程序开发、简化测试以及更好地描述核心性能。目标将趋向于复用性、封装性、整合性以及更简洁的代码。这也是Web组件（HTML)以及Houdini特别任务组（CSS工作组与技术架构组）当前所关注的工作。在真正的Web应用程序方面，现处于通过改善离线状态的缓存模型，实现生命周期管理（安装与升级）以及所需的后台处理来加强服务工作框架的阶段。</p>

	<p>Web安全已成为当下的一个重要问题，因为随着诸如数据窃取、恶意软件威胁以及无处不在的监控等突发事件不断凸显，开放Web平台持续发展且越来越强大，数以百万计的网络硬件设备联机在线，Web平台对信任与安全的需求远超以往任何时期。W3C在Web加密、Web应用程序安全以及Web身份验证方面能够解决Web安全问题。</p>

	<h3 id="nbt-webrtc">8.3 Web实时通讯</h3>
	<p>开放Web平台被可用于丰富的、交互性的、跨平台的应用程序。实时对话在生活中占据重要地位。WebRTC是W3C将世界级的实时通信服务扩展至任何网络任何设备的初步尝试。正如当前关注WebRTC一样，W3C接下来的工作将进一步围绕麦克风与摄像机访问以及录音等方面展开。我们还必须思索如何将最近在增强与虚拟现实方面的发展纳入考虑。（详见下文）</p>

	<h3 id="nbt-webpayments">8.4 Web支付</h3>
	<p>下一阶段电子商务的标准将趋于安全与精简。电子商务每年潜在1.5万亿美元，从以商业为中心（merchant-centric）逐步发展到以客户为中心，如今更是一种Web式的体验。其遵循一个omni-change模式，客户从笔记本电脑或移动端将店内与在线服务相结合，而且在此模式中灵活与安全的支付方式将是不可或缺的。<br>从支付流程的表现形式到支付启动的体系结构，W3C标准进一步扩展开放Web平台的功能、特性以及互操作性，以期Web可以更好地将人类与其经济潜力相结合。</p>

	<h3 id="nbt-industry">8.5 产业支撑</h3>
	<p>在W3C致力于充分展现开放Web潜能时，在其水平领域的每个关键标准计划中都至少有一个垂直行业的支撑。（了解如何相互交叉）。2011年加入W3C的会员中超过50%的成员旨在参与某些特定的垂直行业，受基于满足业务承诺需求的驱动，通过全球化或包容性的方式解决专门针对Web的挑战。而这些的进一步发展与强化，也恰恰印证了我们下一阶段的工作重心。</p>

	<h3 id="nbt-wot">8.6 物联万维网（Web of Things）</h3>
	<p>连接到Web的设备数量正不断上升。Juniper研究预计（<a href="http://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/iot-connected-devices-to-triple-to-38-bn-by-2020">estimates</a>）到2020年连接设备的数量将提升至385亿（截至2015年连接设备的数量为134亿）。Web of Things是在物联网平台基础上打破隔阂实现开放市场的可互操作层面。</p>

	<h3 id="nbt-vr">8.7 虚拟现实</h3>
	<p>Web和虚拟现实（<a href="file:///wiki/Headlights2016#Web_and_Virtual_Reality">Web and Virtual Reality</a>）是W3C2016年度Headlights实践的项目之一（Headlights是W3C团队分析识别W3C潜在关注方向的文档）。随着虚拟现实产品和解决方案的逐渐兴起，我们不但需要确保我们了解Web是否以及如何能够在这个空间中占有一席之地并发挥相应作用，同时还需要实时跟踪由此衍生出的标准化需求。应用程序涉及的范围十分广泛：游戏、社交、娱乐、工程、培训、电子商务、房地产、旅游、新闻等等。目前已知的缺口包括编解码、HTML集成、Web音频流媒体、3D渲染、运动检测等。</p>

	<h2 id="conclusion">9. 结论</h2>
	<p>Web是有史以来可实现互操作的最佳平台。Web自身的发展不断推动着产业转变，各产业也不断影响着开放Web平台的发展。W3C理应扩展Web性能，进一步提升Web平台的安全标准，建设适用于分布式应用程序的更加强健有力以及更易为开发人员所使用的开放Web平台。</p>
	<p>自建立之初就作为全人类进步平台的Web，现如今已经演变为具有巨大实际使用价值的工具与服务。通过向数字出版、汽车、娱乐以及通信等纵向领域各行业的扩展，同时基于Web社区如何使用Web技术以及各种技术需求的现状，当前W3C正与Web社区携手合作，共同致力于转变并实现更加广泛的Web性能。通过关联方式、开发者渠道以及不断扩展的会员关系，W3C在持续强化与产业界联结的同时，也在进一步促进范围更加广泛的互操作性。不断发展壮大的W3C所具备的良好条件，将足以引导下一阶段的Web技术发展，并在开拓开放Web平台、促进人类不断进步方面发挥重要的引领作用。</p>
